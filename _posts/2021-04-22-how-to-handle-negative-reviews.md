Inevitably you will receive a poor review while building your online reputation.  Have no fear this happens to all businesses and we have come up with a list of 5 ideas on how to handle negative reviews.

## 1. Response As Soon As Possible

By responding quickly to a negative review you show the customer their opinion matters and having a bad experience is something you are willing to work on fixing.

The longer a negative review sits without a response increases the likelihood potential customers are seeing someone had a bad experience and the business isn't going to do anything about it.

## 2. Approach With Empathy

Even though this customer just said something negative about your business you will want to take a step back, breath, and approach the response from a place of empathy and understanding.

Never reply to a message if you are feeling upset or want to attack the person leaving the review.  As much as you try, these messages will come off poorly and could cause a larger issue.

## 3. Go Above and Beyond

Acknowledging the customer had a bad experience and saying sorry is a great start.

However, to show you take their feedback seriously, offering them something more is a great sign to those reading the reviews on how you treat customers.

## 4. Make It Specific To Each Situation

Avoid having a candid response to the negative reviews.  

You will want to make sure each response to a negative review is authentic and addresses the individualâ€™s concern in each review.

This will prevent people from thinking these responses are automated and not genuine due to lack of effort used when replying with a general message.

## 5. Look For Common Scenarios

Pay attention to what people are saying in their negative reviews.  

Is there a common theme among them that is part of a larger issue in your business?

Connecting the dots of what people are saying negatively about their experience is a great way to make changes to increase everyone's experience.

## Preparing For Negative Reviews

With these five tips you are in a good starting point for answering negative reviews.  

Just remember the person who wrote the review wanted to enjoy your product or service but unfortunately had a bad experience.  The upside is most are willing to try again if the owner shows he or she is truly wanting what is best for the customer.
