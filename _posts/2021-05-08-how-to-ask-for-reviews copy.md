Asking for a review can be tricky.

To try and help our customers, we have created a list of three Do’s and three Don'ts when asking for a review.

## Do - Have a Clear and Personalized Subject Line

A successful email subject describes what your email will be about.  

It is the first thing users see when checking their email and we want to make sure to draw their attention to this email and then read it when it is open.

To see a list of good email subject lines and when to use them go to our post about [Email Subject Line Ideas][email-subject-line-ideas]

## Don’t - Offer an Incentive

Depending on the site you want your review for, there may be some guidelines preventing you from using incentives to get feedback.

Before using an incentive in your email or text message make sure to know the review site’s guidelines to avoid any issues with how the review was collected.

One example of this is Google.  As of October 2020, Google banned using incentives to get customer feedback.  So, if you are using Google and do not want to be penalized when getting reviews, make sure to not incentivize it.

## Do - Ask a Question

Subject lines that ask a question have been shown to increase open rates.  

Something that entices the user and makes them want to learn more will help get them to open the email and read the relevant, compelling email body.

Including something like “What did you think? We would like to hear your review about [product/service name]."  Is a great way for people to know you are looking for their opinion and for which product/service you want their opinion.

## Don’t - Make the Emails Too Long

Make the email body fit in the size of a mobile phone screen.  

Our attention spans have been decreasing and the customer wants to get to the point quickly. Long winded emails will discourage the customer and most likely have them deleting the email before finishing.

By having a compact email body it not only gets to the point quickly but it will help draw attention to the call to action.

## Do - Include a Call To Action

Make sure to be clear on what you want.

Having a call to action button or link will let your customers know you want them to leave a review and where to leave it.

This helps bring down their defenses when reading the email because they will know you value their opinion and want to have them share it.

## Don’t - USE UPPER CASE

Lastly, don’t USE UPPER CASE.  

It may feel as though you are yelling at your customer and the last thing you want to do is have them feeling attacked before asking them to leave a review of your product/service.

Opening with a nice but to the point sentence is much more effective and will put your customer in a more relaxed state.

## Let’s Get Some Reviews

With these three do’s and don’ts it should help increase open rates, get feedback, and build more brand awareness.

With a bit of practice and a little testing to find the right message, getting those reviews is within reach!
