Although Dovera Insights helps streamline the process of gathering customer feedback and online reviews we understand that it isnâ€™t for everyone.

To help, we wanted to provide some alternatives for those still wanting to get feedback and grow their online reviews.

## Manually Sending Emails or Texts

The first option would be to simply send the customers you would like feedback from an email or text asking them for their feedback or to leave a review on the review site of your choice.

This allows for you to be more personal and you have a pretty good idea they will be leaving positive feedback.

This can be time consuming but a great place to start when wanting to see how reviews impact your overall business.

## Automate Sending Emails or Texts

The next step would be to automate the sending of emails and texts. This will allow you to reach a broader audience and possibly grow those reviews much faster.

One thing to think about with this approach is to make sure to keep track of the customers you have already sent the emails and texts to after they have already left feedback.  

You do not want to come off too spammy when sending these or they may start to get blocked.

## Review Management Software

This is for the companies who know the value in getting reviews, want to save time doing it and avoid coming off too spammy after someone has already left feedback.

Review management software usually allows notifications to be sent when someone has left feedback so you can be notified if a negative review was submitted. This will allow for faster a response time when helping solve an issue.

## How To Pick

Like most things there is a trade off of time and money.  

Doing things manually will save you money. It will also allow for a more personalized message and almost guaranteed positive review but can be time consuming.

Fully automated review management software will help scale getting customer feedback and online reviews but most will cost money and can limit how personalized a message will be.

At the end of the day either approach is better than not hearing what kind of experience your customers had with the product or service you provide, so get out there and start getting those reviews!
