It has been a few days since you last provided value to one of your customers and you would like to know how things are going for them.

There are many ways to reach out to your customer to get their feedback but with today's technology, email is a great way to achieve getting this feedback.  

There is one potential downside to this strategy and that is everyone has too many emails already, so we need to make sure the email’s we are sending catch the reader's attention.

Your customers should be excited to hear from you, they just got a great deal and now you would like them to share their opinion about it.  Who doesn’t like to talk about themselves?

To grab the reader's attention we should create a subject lines with one of the following traits:

* Generate curiosity
* Create a sense of urgency
* Being trustworthy

## Generate curiosity

* [Customer name], what if we added this feature to our [service]?
* [Customer name], can you help us decide?
* [Customer name], we are thinking of changing our [service].
* [Customer name], does adding this to our [service] make it better?
* [Customer name], our [service] is changing and we need your help.

Well, are you at least a little bit curious about what we are doing to our service and how it might impact your current workflow with our service?

The idea here is to grab their attention so they will open the email with curiosity and be willing to share their opinion about how these new features/concepts can help your service expand.

## Create a sense of urgency

* Urgent: [Customer name], we need your help...
* Our [product] is in trouble and we urgently need your input.
* [Customer name], the [service] you enjoy needs your help.
* Right now our [service] is changing and your input is needed.

By creating a sense of urgency the reader is more likely to click it and see what actions they can take to help instead of ignoring or deleting it.  

Be careful with creating the sense of urgency, if it is too exaggerated or coming from a place of insincerity the reader will know and delete it before he or she is even done reading the subject line.

## Being grateful

* Thank you, [Customer name] for your purchase, please take a moment to review us.
* [Customer name], we take reviews seriously and would be grateful for your input.
* Reviews help us grow our [service], we would appreciate any feedback.
* Thank you for your business, would you be willing to tell us how we did?
* [Customer name], we will be forever grateful for your feedback.

Being grateful in the subject line lets the reader know he or she is important to you and will be more open to going that extra mile to help your business.

Make sure to be honest and sincere on how your customers can help to avoid making them feel like they were tricked into opening the email and taking an action.

## Wrapping up

Having multiple ways to approach getting an online review will help find the subject line that will work the best for your target audience.

A simple way to track this would be a spreadsheet that contains the customer's name and which subject line was used when asking them for review.  You could then later match who has left a review and what subject line they had. This will let you know which subject line is best for your audience.

Another option would be to use an online review management system that would help with managing the multiple ways to send emails with different subject lines and track down which subject line is converting to online reviews.
