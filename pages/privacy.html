  <h4>
    I. Introduction
  </h4>
  <p>
    {{site.company}}, a service developed by {{site.business}}, respects your privacy and is committed to protecting
    it through our compliance with this Privacy Policy.
    This Privacy Policy describes the information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use
    {{site.company}} and visit the website.
    It also explains our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.
    Depending on your activities when using or accessing {{site.company}}, or the functionality, applications, or
    platforms associated with {{site.company}} (collectively, the “Services”), you may from time to time be required
    to agree to additional terms and conditions.
    This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by (i) us offline or through any other means,
    including on any other website operated by {{site.company}} or any third party, or (ii) any third party, including
    through any application or content that may link to or be accessible from {{site.company}} through its website or
    Mobile Application.
    This Privacy Policy applies regardless of whether you use our Services via a computer, mobile device or other
    platform (collectively, your “Equipment”).
  </p>
  <p>
    Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and
    how we will treat it.
    If you do not agree with our policies or practices, you must not use our Website or Mobile Application.
    By accessing or using the Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h4>
    II. Modifications to This Privacy Policy
  </h4>
  <p>
    We generally keep this Privacy Policy posted on our Website and Mobile Application.
    You should review this Privacy Policy frequently, as it may change from time to time without notice.
    Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy.
    WHEN YOU USE OUR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY
    CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP USING OUR SERVICES.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note, however, that if we decide to use your personally identifiable information in a manner materially
    different than what is provided in this Privacy Policy or what we advised at the time it was collected, we will
    notify you of this change by e-mail to the last e-mail address provided to us or through our Services.
    You will have a choice (by means of an “opt out” opportunity) as to whether or not we use such information in this
    different manner.
    In such case, we will use your personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms in place when the
    information was collected.
  </p>
  <h4>
    III. Information We Collect
  </h4>
  <p>
    We typically collect two kinds of information about you when you use our Services: (a) information that you
    provide that personally identifies you; and (b) information that does not personally identify you that we
    automatically collect or that you provide to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally Identifiable Information: Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any
    information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, mail address, phone
    number, etc.
    As a general policy, we do not automatically collect your personally identifiable information when you visit our
    Website or use our Mobil Application.
    In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your personally
    identifiable information in connection with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of our Services.
    For instance, you may: (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, email address, credit card number and phone
    number when registering or in connection with ordering, purchasing, or subscribing; (b) provide certain
    demographic information about you (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, usage frequency, etc.) when using our
    Services, or participating in a survey or poll; or (c) post a general comment and/or recommendation on our Website
    or through our Services.
    Certain information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so
    when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name). Whether or not you provide this information is
    your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular
    activity, realize a benefit we may offer, or gain access to certain content or features available through our
    Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Non-Personally Identifiable Information: Our definition of non-personally identifiable information is any
    information that does not personally identify you.
    Non-personally identifiable information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been
    de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous.
    We obtain non-personally identifiable information about you from information that you provide us, either
    separately or together with your personally identifiable information.
    We also automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information from you when you access use our
    Services through your Equipment.
    This information can include, among other things, your device, wireless carrier, IP addresses, the type of browser
    you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc.), the third party website from which your
    visit originated, the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Mac OS, Android, iPhone, etc.), the
    domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, NetZero, etc.), the search terms you use; and
    how much you use our Services.
  </p>
  <h4>
    IV. How We Use &amp; Share the Information Collected
  </h4>
  <p>
    Personally Identifiable Information: The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to
    carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you, or in other ways naturally associated with
    the circumstances in which you provided the information.
    We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service,
    providing you promotional information for our products, or to communicate with you about content or other
    information you have posted or shared with us via use of our Services.
    You may opt-out from receiving future promotional information from us as set forth below.
  </p>
  <p>
    In certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information with our third party vendors
    performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies) – e.g., vendors that process credit
    card orders, administer our promotions, assist us with customer service, etc.
    Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry out our requests.
    Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your
    personally identifiable information will not be shared or sold to any third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We use non-personally identifiable information in a variety of ways.
    For example, we may use non-personally identifiable information to evaluate use of our Services (e.g., visits to
    our Website, use of our Mobile Application, etc.), track the types of products being purchased, gauge coupon
    redemption rates, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, and to improve
    our Services.
    We may use your non-personally identifiable information by itself or aggregate it with information we have
    obtained from other customers or other sources.
    It is important to remember that your non-personally identifiable information (whether standing alone or combined
    with other non-personally identifiable information) is anonymous information that does not personally identify
    you.
  </p>
  <h4>
    V. Cookies and Preference Based Advertising
  </h4>
  <p>
    Cookies and Web Beacons: We use “cookies” to obtain certain types of information when you access our Website or
    Mobile Application via your Equipment.
    “Cookies” are small files that we transfer to your Equipment’s hard drive, memory or web browser to enable our
    systems to recognize you.
    For instance, cookies allow us to remember Service preferences you have previously set.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of the information we collect and analyze in this manner include the Internet protocol (IP) address used
    to connect your Equipment to the Internet; your browser type and version, operating system, and platform; your
    activities on our Website, including the URL you come from and go to next (whether this URL is on our site or
    not); and cookie number.
    It is important to note that the cookies we use do not contain and are not tied to personally identifiable
    information.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are concerned about the storage and use of cookies, you may be able to delete cookies manually from your
    hard drive or mobile device or take other steps to prevent cookies from loading in the first place.
    Please note, however, that some portions of our Services may not function properly or be available to you if you
    refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the acceptance of cookies.
  </p>
  <h4>
    VI. Other Uses &amp; Information
  </h4>
  <p>
    IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your Equipment whenever you access the
    Internet. Web servers (computers that “serve up” web pages) automatically identify your Equipment by its IP
    address.
    When visitors request pages from our Website, our servers typically log their IP addresses.
    We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to
    others, and to track the use of our Services.
    IP addresses are considered non-personally identifiable information and may also be shared as provided above.
    It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable; that is, the visitor’s session
    will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.
    However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor at the request of the visitor or when we
    feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Service rules or to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b)
    conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our
    Services, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our customers or the general
    public.
  </p>
  <p>
    Email Communications: If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personally identifiable
    information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future
    reference.
    For security reasons, we do not recommend that you send non-public personal information, such as passwords, social
    security numbers, or bank account information, to us by email.
    Aside from our reply to such an email, however, it is not our standard practice to send you email unless you
    request a particular service or sign up for a feature that involves email communications, it relates to purchases
    you have made with us (e.g., product updates, customer support, etc.), we are sending you information about our
    other products and services, or you consented to being contacted by email for a particular purpose.
    In certain instances, we may provide you with the option to set your preferences for receiving email
    communications from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others. You may “opt out” of receiving
    future commercial email communications from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included at the bottom of most
    emails we send, or as provided below; provided, however, we reserve the right to send you transactional emails
    such as customer service communications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transfer of Assets: As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets.
    If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the personally identifiable information
    and non-personally identifiable information we have about you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring
    entity, though we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your preferences are followed.
    Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be
    considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other: Regardless of any other provision in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to disclose any personally
    identifiable or non-personally identifiable information about you if we are required to do so by law, with respect
    to copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is necessary
    to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect
    or defend our legal rights or property, our Services, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health
    and safety of our customers or the general public.
  </p>
  <h4>
    VII. Children
  </h4>
  <p>
    The features, programs, promotions and other aspects of our Services requiring the submission of personally
    identifiable information are not intended for children.
    We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18.
    If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 and believe he or she has disclosed personally
    identifiable information to us please contact us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>.
    A parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 may review and request deletion of such child’s personally
    identifiable information as well as prohibit the use of that information.
    If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 18 without verification of
    parental consent, we will delete that information.
  </p>
  <h4>
    VIII. Keeping Your Information Secure
  </h4>
  <p>
    We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse
    and alteration of the information under our control.
    Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy,
    we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online or through
    our Services, and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally
    identifiable information.
    In the unfortunate event that your “personally identifiable information” (as the term or similar terms are defined
    by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our
    sole and absolute discretion) to the last e-mail address you have provided us in the most expedient time
    reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary
    measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the
    legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation.
    From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, we upgrade our
    information security systems.
  </p>
  <h4>
    IX. Other Sites/Links
  </h4>
  <p>
    Our Services may link to or contain links to other third party websites that we do not control or maintain, such
    as in connection with purchasing products we may recommend or reference via our Services and/or advertisements you
    may see while using our Services.
    We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party website.
    We encourage you to read the privacy statements of all third party websites before submitting any personally
    identifiable information through these websites.
